# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

Hi my name is Daniel (he/him)! Ive been playing games for as long as I can remember. Early days, I played a ton of Minecraft, but these days I play more rougelikes whenever I find the time. Some of my favorite games are Incryption, Enter the Gungeon, and Risk of Rain 2. I also play some comp shooters like Overwatch sometimes. I don't have experience with game development but I have been coding for the last 3 years so I have a decent amount of C++, Java, and HTML experience. I am a CS major hoping to declare GDIM as a double major and I would love to create a Rougelike type game.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [I am trying to declare GDIM as a double major] Game Design & Interactive Media
